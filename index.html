		<h1>Spencer's Website</h1>
		<p>Welcome!  This is my website.  I'm Spencer.  Isn't it amazing?  I hope you enjoy your stay.
		If you get bored, just leave.  Bored already?  I can't say I blame you.  There isn't much here, is there.
		Well, sometimes in life that's just how it is.  Okay, you can go now, but I hope you'll always hold a
		special place in your heart for this page and return often to reflect on the meaning of life, the universe,
		and everything.
